## Hey there, I'm Soham!

I'm a Data Science grad student at RIT in Rochesterâ€”originally from Pune, India! With a background in Mechanical Engineering and hands-on experience in data engineering from Cognizant, I love mixing logic with a dash of creativity.

### Currently working on:
- **Personal Website Revamp:** Moving my personal website from a Google Sites implementation to one that is made and designed by me for finer control.
- **Workout Analyzer/Tracker:** A workout analyzer for the history of me working out, looking into making a tracking app myself as well.

### Quick Facts
- I like tinkering: physically and in code.
- Gym rat and badminton enthusiast.
- Car fanatic who never misses an automotive chat.
